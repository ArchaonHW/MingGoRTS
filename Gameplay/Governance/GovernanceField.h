// Tracked deeds:
//   * Village occupation — exclusive presence held for OCCUPY_TICKS.
//   * Village burning — an authored doctrine `burn` action applying

//   * Convoy escort — a convoy completing its route (ConvoyArrived).
//   * Convoy raid — a convoy caught in a region with enemy presence
//     and no defender.
//
// Everything is deterministic: fixed scan order (map order for
// villages, convoy index for convoys, squad index for witnesses),
// no PRNG draws.
