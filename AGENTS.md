## MingGoRTS / PotatoEngine

C++20 game engine (PotatoEngine) + greenfield game layer (MingGoRTS). Planning artifacts live in `_bmad-output/` (GDD, `game-architecture.md`, `narrative-design.md`, `planning-artifacts/epics.md`, `implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`); these are authoritative over README status claims.

## Policy

- Never push to `main`/`develop`; PRs only, Conventional Commits.
- Never modify `external/` — vendored dependencies.
- No third-party JSON libraries; use the game-layer `JsonValue` (to be built in `Gameplay/Json/`).
- No unsafe C functions: `gets`, `strcpy`, `strcat`, `sprintf`, `vsprintf`, `scanf`.
- All game content files are versioned JSON: `potato.<name>/<ver>` header, reject bad schema without mutating state.
- Saves write via temp-file + rename (atomic).

## Where things are

- Engine subsystems: top-level dirs (`Core/`, `ECS/`, `Events/`, `Rendering/`, `Serialization/`, `GUI/`, ...).
- Game layer (planned, may not exist yet): `Gameplay/` sim → `Campaign/` → `Game/` shell → `assets/`.
- Executable examples/tests: `Examples/` — each is its own `add_executable` target.
- Story files and sprint tracking: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/`.

## Running and verifying

- Build (Windows/MSVC): `BuildEngine.bat`, or `cmake -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64` then `cmake --build build --config Release`.
- MinGW builds: guard toolchain specifics with `WIN32 AND NOT MSVC`; verify both MSVC and MinGW before calling work done.
- No unified test command — there is no CTest; tests are standalone executables under `Examples/`. Game-layer tests use the `potato_test_<name>` convention (POTATO_TESTS option is planned, not yet in CMake).
- Environment: `git`, `python`, `uv` are NOT on PATH here — don't script around them.

## Conventions that differ from defaults

- `Gameplay/` must compile headless: no Rendering/GUI/OpenGL includes; dependency direction is Engine ← Gameplay ← Campaign ← Game, single direction only.
- Simulation is deterministic: fixed 20 Hz tick, integer/fixed-point only (no floats in sim), one seeded PRNG stream, canonical eval order (squad index → slot index).
- Truth boundary: nothing outside `Gameplay/Sim/` reads true enemy state — presentation and doctrine conditions read certainty only.
- Two event regimes: typed `SimEvent` list inside the sim (recorded for replay); engine `EventBus` only at layer boundaries — subscribers never write `BattleState`.
- `PotatoEngine` facade subsystem accessors are commented out — bind engine leaf modules directly; do not "fix" the facade as a side task.
- Error handling: no exceptions in the tick path; `Result<T>` at I/O/content boundaries; registries immutable during battle; zero file I/O in the tick path.

## Known pitfalls

- README describes aspirational state (completed epics, existing `Gameplay/`, old planning paths) that does not match the filesystem — trust `_bmad-output/` documents and the actual tree, not README status lines.
- PowerShell here-strings treat backticks as escapes — prefer `[IO.File]::WriteAllText` with single-quoted here-strings when writing content containing backticks.
- The repo path contains CJK (`F:\民國史詩`) — MinGW make and FetchContent subbuilds fail on it ("Illegal byte sequence"). Build via an ASCII junction, e.g. `F:\dev\MingGoRTS -> F:\民國史詩\HWC\MingGoRTS` (older sessions may reference `C:\MingGoRTS`, a legacy alias of the same junction — prefer F: to keep workspace off the system drive).
- `PotatoEngine` static lib does not compile under MinGW (`Security/SecuritySystem.cpp` uses MSVC-isms) — `PotatoGameplay` deliberately does not link it yet. For headless builds use `-DPOTATO_BUILD_GUI=OFF` (skips glfw/glad FetchContent, which also needs git/network).
